Here are some more Info commands that make it easier to move around.
`g' goes to a node by name
--------------------------
If you know a node's name, you can go there by typing `g', the name,
and <RET>.  Thus, `g Top<RET>' would go to the node called `Top' in this
file. 
`g Advanced<RET>' would come back here.  `g' in Emacs runs the command
`Info-goto-node'.
   Unlike `m', `g' does not allow the use of abbreviations.  But it
does allow completion.
   To go to a node in another file, you can include the file name in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
`g(dir)Top<RET>' would go to the Info Directory node, which is the node
`Top' in the Info file `dir'.  Likewise, `g(emacs)Top<RET>' goes to the
top node of the Emacs manual.
`1'-`9' choose a menu subtopic by its number
--------------------------------------------
If you begrudge each character of type-in which your system requires,
you might like to use the commands `1', `2', `3', `4', ..., `9'.  They
are short for the `m' command together with a name of a menu subtopic.
`1' goes through the first item in the current node's menu; `2' goes
through the second item, etc.

1.2 How to search Info documents for specific subjects
======================================================

The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read the
entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find some
information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don't know or
don't remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when you
use a manual as a "reference", or when it is impractical to read the
entire manual before you start using the programs it describes.

   Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual indices or its text.

   Since most subjects related to what the manual describes should be
indexed, you should try the index search first.  The `i' command
prompts you for a subject and then looks up that subject in the
indices.  If it finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it
goes to the node to which that index entry points.  You should browse
through that node to see whether the issue you are looking for is
described there.  If it isn't, type `,' one or more times to go through
additional index entries which match your subject.

To get out of Info, back to what you were doing before, type `q' for
"Quit". 
   This is the end of the basic course on using Info.  You have learned
how to move in an Info document, and how to follow menus and cross
references.  This makes you ready for reading manuals top to bottom, as
new users should do when they learn a new package.

   Another set of Info commands is useful when you need to find
something quickly in a manual--that is, when you need to use a manual
as a reference rather than as a tutorial.  We urge you to learn these
search commands as well.  
If you want to do that now, follow this link ([::1.2]Info Search).
