[Top:An Introduction] 

The GNU Project distributes most of its on-line manuals in the "Info
format", which you read using an "Info reader".  You are probably using
an Info reader to read this now.

   There are two primary Info readers: `info', a stand-alone program
designed just to read Info files, and the `info' package in GNU Emacs,
a general-purpose editor.  At present, only the Emacs reader supports
using a mouse.
    For getting started type "m Getting Started" an then <RET>.
* Menu:

* ([G_S.txt::1]Getting Started)         Getting started using an Info reader.
* ([E_I.txt::1]Expert Info)             Info commands for experts.
* ([E_I.txt::2]Finish)                  Quitting and some information.
