[1: Getting Started]

This first part of this Info manual describes how to get around inside
of Info.  The second part of the manual describes various advanced Info
commands, and how to write an Info as distinct from a Texinfo file.
The third part briefly explains how to generate Info files from Texinfo
files.

[1.1: Help-Small-Screen]

Since your terminal has a relatively small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.

   If you see the text `--All----' near the bottom right corner of the
screen, it means the entire text you are looking at fits on the screen.
If you see `--Top----' instead, it means that there is more text below
that does not fit.  To move forward through the text and see another
screen full, press "f".  To move back up, press the "b"
   Here are 40 lines of junk, so you can try f and b and see
what they do.  At the end are instructions of what you should do next.

So now type an `n'--just one character; don't type the 
quotes and don't type the Return key
afterward--to get to the normal start of the course.

[1.2: How to use Info]

You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.


   Right now you are looking at one "Node" of Information.  A node
contains text describing a specific topic at a specific level of
detail.  This node's topic is "how to use Info".  The mode line says
that this is node `Help' in the file `info'.

   The top line of a node is its "header".  This node's header (look at
it now) says that the `Next' node after this one is the node called
`Help-P'.  An advanced Info command lets you go to any node whose name
you know.  In the stand-alone Info reader program, the header line
shows the names of this node and the info file as well.  In Emacs, the
header line is duplicated in a special typeface, and the duplicate
remains at the top of the window all the time even if you scroll
through the node.

   Besides a `Next', a node can have a `Previous' link, or an `Up'
link, or both.  As you can see, this node has all of these links.

   Now it is time to move on to the `Next' node, named `Help-P'.

  Type `n' to move there.  Type just one character;
%%

[1.3: Help-P]

This node is called `Help-P'.  The `Previous' node, as you see, is
`Help', which is the one you just came from using the `n' command.
Another `n' command now would take you to the next node, `Help-^L'.

   But do not type `n' yet.  First, try the `p' command, or
   (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button on the `Prev' link.
   That takes you to the `Previous' node.  Then use `n' to
   return here.

   If you read this in Emacs, you will see an `Info' item in the menu
bar, close to its right edge.  Clicking the mouse on the `Info'
menu-bar item opens a menu of commands which include `Next' and `Prev'
(and also some others which you didn't yet learn about).

   This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but _please
don't_ start skimming.  Things will get complicated soon enough!  Also,
please do not try a new command until you are told it is time to.  You
could make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.

   Now do an `n', or (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button on
   the `Next' link, to get to the node `Help-^L' and learn more.

[1.4: Help-Link]

 There can exist some links to other topics of the documentation .If you
 want to follow this links you have to use "g " command .After typing "g"
 you have to write the name of the link .There is no abbreviation accepted .
 You can recognize a link because it is written in brackets and in 
 upperlevel.For example ([::1.4.1]Example Link) is a link to one of the nodes
 in the documentation system.There can be some links to other nodes in a
 different document too like ([E_I.txt::1]To top of other document).

[1.4.1: Example Link]

   You have reached here by using a link in upper level.
